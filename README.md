Here are the rules to play Wordle:
Objective

    Goal: Guess a hidden 5-letter word within six attempts.

How to Play

    Start the Game:
        You have six chances to guess the hidden word.
        Enter any 5-letter word as your first guess.

    Feedback on Your Guess:
        After each guess, the letters of the word will change color to give you hints:
            Green: The letter is in the correct position.
            Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
            Gray: The letter is not in the word at all.

    Continue Guessing:
        Use the feedback to make your next guess. Try different combinations of letters while paying attention to the colored hints.
        Keep guessing until you either:
            Correctly guess the word (all letters turn green).
            Run out of attempts (six guesses).

Winning or Losing

    Win: If you guess the word within six tries, you win!
    Lose: If you don't guess the word within six attempts, you lose, and the correct word is revealed.

Tips

    Think strategically and consider using common vowels and consonants early on to narrow down possibilities.
    Use previous guesses and their feedback to eliminate unlikely letters or positions.

Enjoy the challenge and have fun!
